    		<h2>Read this BEFORE imaging specimens</h2>
    			<p>This method for detecting stomata requires high magnification images of epidermal surfaces that are in focus and relatively free of preparation and anatomical features (e.g. trichomes) that distort the visual identification of stoma. If you can't decide if it's a stoma, the network may not either. You are responsbile for creating a collection of high quality, homogenous images. All input images <strong>must be taken at 400x</strong>. Color images do not help or hurt. Small sized images upload faster than larger ones. Do your self a favor and limit file sizes to 1 mb or even less when possible. To help you understand the distribution of error, you can annotate a set of images after they have been uploaded and stomata automatically detected. If the network performs poorly on your images, annotate the stomata and contact us. We may add your material to the training database and retrain the network.</p>
