		<h2>Welcome to StomataCounter!</h2>
			<p>StomataCounter is a website and method for automatic detection of stomata from well-prepared micrographs of plant cuticles. StomataCounter uses a fully-convolutional neural network trained on over 4,700 micrographs from over 700 species to identify stomata. The training set of images was collected with SEM, differential interference contrast, and brightfield microscopy, and as such, is robust to these methods. Before collecting images to use with StomataCounter, please try out a few different imaging and sample preperation methods to find out what works best. As the axiom goes: junk in, junk out. We have found that 400x magnification with DIC microscopy of samples created from nail polish epidermal peels works well. To use the method, save your images as jpegs and upload a zip file of your dataset. Try to minimize file size when imaging - you don't need all those extra bytes to get a good image - to a few hundred kB. After uploading images, you can manually annotate them to get a sense of the error in your dataset. If the method performs poorly on your images, annotate the stomata and contact us. We may add your material to the training database and retrain the network.</p>
